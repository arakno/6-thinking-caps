# Sample Inputs for 6 Thinking Hats Analysis

This document provides sample problem statements and background context that will generate comprehensive results from all 6 thinking hat perspectives.

## Sample 1: Company Expansion Decision

**Problem Statement:**
Our software company wants to expand into the Asian market within the next 2 years. We're considering opening an office in Singapore and hiring 50 engineers. Should we proceed with this expansion?

**Background Context:**
We currently have 200 employees in the US, with strong revenue growth of 35% YoY. Our product is a SaaS platform for enterprise data analytics. We have limited experience in Asian markets but see huge potential. Initial estimates show we'd need $5M investment for infrastructure, team building, and localization. Competition in Singapore is fierce with established players like regional tech companies.

**Expected Results:**
- **White Hat**: Factual data about market size, growth rates, competitor analysis, hiring costs
- **Red Hat**: Gut feelings, team excitement/concerns, emotional risks, cultural fit worries
- **Black Hat**: Risks like market saturation, currency fluctuations, talent retention, regulatory issues
- **Yellow Hat**: Opportunities like market growth, new customer base, talent acquisition, brand expansion
- **Green Hat**: Creative solutions like partnership models, phased rollout, localization strategies
- **Blue Hat**: Strategic synthesis, decision framework, implementation roadmap

## Sample 2: Product Pivot Strategy

**Problem Statement:**
Our mobile app for fitness tracking has hit a plateau with 100K users. We're considering pivoting to focus on corporate wellness programs for enterprises. Is this the right move?

**Background Context:**
The app generates $50K monthly revenue from subscriptions but growth has stalled. We have 5 engineers and 2 product managers. Market research shows enterprise wellness is growing 25% annually, but requires different sales approach and features. We'd need to rebuild 40% of the product and hire 2 enterprise sales reps. Our team has limited B2B sales experience.

**Expected Results:**
- **White Hat**: Market data, growth projections, customer acquisition costs comparison, feature requirements
- **Red Hat**: Team's passion for B2B vs B2C, concerns about the pivot, excitement about new markets
- **Black Hat**: Risk of alienating existing users, competition from established wellness platforms, team capacity
- **Yellow Hat**: Enterprise spending power, recurring revenue potential, team skill development, partnership opportunities
- **Green Hat**: Hybrid model ideas, phased transition, API partnerships, white-label options
- **Blue Hat**: Overall recommendation, risk mitigation strategy, success metrics, go/no-go criteria

## Sample 3: Remote Work Policy Change

**Problem Statement:**
We're considering changing our work policy from flexible remote to full-time in-office, 5 days a week. We believe this will improve collaboration and innovation. How should we approach this?

**Background Context:**
Our team of 80 people has been 80% remote for the past 3 years since COVID. Productivity metrics are strong, but some managers report reduced team cohesion. Our lease on our office space costs $200K/month and is currently underutilized. We're concerned about recruiting top talent who prefer remote work. Recent surveys show 65% of employees want hybrid/remote options.

**Expected Results:**
- **White Hat**: Employee retention statistics, productivity metrics, office costs, recruitment data by location
- **Red Hat**: Employees' feelings about the change, team morale concerns, excitement vs resistance
- **Black Hat**: Risk of employee turnover, talent loss, competitive disadvantage, implementation challenges
- **Yellow Hat**: Improved teamwork, innovation boost, company culture strengthening, office utilization benefits
- **Green Hat**: Hybrid compromise solutions, office redesign for collaboration days, flexible scheduling models
- **Blue Hat**: Recommended policy change approach, phased implementation, measurement framework

## Sample 4: Pricing Strategy Update

**Problem Statement:**
Our B2B SaaS product is currently priced at $299/month for all customers. We're considering implementing tiered pricing (Starter $99, Pro $299, Enterprise $999) to capture more customers and increase revenue from large accounts. Should we make this change?

**Background Context:**
We currently have 300 customers all paying $299/month ($90K MRR). Data shows 30% of customers feel the price is too high and another 40% say they'd pay more for additional features. Our main competitors have tiered pricing. We estimate tiered pricing could increase MRR to $150K but might alienate some existing customers. We have no dedicated pricing optimization team.

**Expected Results:**
- **White Hat**: Customer segmentation data, competitor pricing analysis, revenue projections, market research
- **Red Hat**: Customer satisfaction concerns, sales team confidence about upsells, fear of losing customers
- **Black Hat**: Customer churn risk, competitor response, implementation complexity, customer support burden
- **Yellow Hat**: Revenue growth potential, market expansion into SMB segment, improved customer satisfaction
- **Green Hat**: Granular feature bundles, usage-based pricing alternatives, dynamic pricing models
- **Blue Hat**: Recommended pricing strategy, migration plan, success metrics, timeline

## Sample 5: Technology Stack Modernization

**Problem Statement:**
Our legacy system was built in 2010 using monolithic architecture. We want to modernize it using microservices and modern frameworks. Should we do a complete rewrite or gradual migration?

**Background Context:**
The system handles $10M in annual transactions with 99.8% uptime. It's written in older Java with a relational database. We have 15 developers familiar with the legacy system but limited microservices experience. A complete rewrite would take 18-24 months and cost $2M. A gradual migration would extend to 3 years but allow continuous business operation. The system is becoming difficult to scale and hire for.

**Expected Results:**
- **White Hat**: Technical debt metrics, hiring market data, maintenance cost analysis, benchmarking results
- **Red Hat**: Team's comfort with change, fear of breaking production systems, excitement about modern tech
- **Black Hat**: Risks of downtime, technical complexity, knowledge loss, budget overruns, talent retention
- **Yellow Hat**: Scalability improvements, faster feature development, better developer recruitment, cost savings
- **Green Hat**: Strangler pattern implementation, hybrid approaches, incremental modernization, containerization strategy
- **Blue Hat**: Recommended approach (phased migration), success criteria, resource allocation, stakeholder communication
